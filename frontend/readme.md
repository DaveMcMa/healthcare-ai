This folder contains the code for compiling the frontend docker image (only as reference, not necessary to deploy) as well as the pre-packaged helmchart you can import into your HPE Private Cloud AI AI Essentials interface. The folders "docker_artifacts" and "helm" are only included as references for you to build your own apps in HPE Private Cloud AI - the required work has already been done for you and you just need to import the healthcareai_helm.tgz into your AI Essentials interface via the "Import Framework" option.
