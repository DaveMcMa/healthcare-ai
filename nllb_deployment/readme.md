In this fodler you will find the nllb deployment yaml you can run to deploy the No Language Left Behind model which has been quantized for CPU-optimised inferencing. To run this yaml just run a simple kubectl deploy -f command, making sure to first update the deployment yaml with the namespace of your user within HPE Private Cloud AI AI Essentials. You can test the resulting deployment endpoint using the test notebook located in this folder (make sure to update with your endpoint and token).
